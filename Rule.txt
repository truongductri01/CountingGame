COUNTING GAME
A single player game (will consider to upgrade it to more players)

Rule:
Given a goal number, for example: 30
We will start the game with counting 1 (or 2, or 3).
Two players (you and AI) will take turn counting a number,
who ever reaches counting 30 first will win.
There are only one restriction when counting:
1. The first play will count either 1, 2, or 3.
2. Then for each turn, a player can add 1, 2, or 3
to the current number to create a new one and count it out.
    For example: player 1 counts 1, player 2 can either count 2, 3, or 4.
3. Who counts 30 first will win.


Goals:
1. OOP programming
2. Create different level, where the computer guesses randomly
or tactically
